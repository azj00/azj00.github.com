                <p><b>Sex is a taboo word in China.</b></p>
                <p>I received my very first sexual health education when I was 18 to
                    meet the requirement for Boston Universityâ€™s required sexual misconduct training. By that time,
                    I had already missed the optimal window for sex education, which is shown to be between 9 to
                    12 years old. There are neither required sexual health education classes in most elementary and
                    middle schools nor sexual misconduct training in most colleges in China. Instead, <b>parents seem
                    to be the primary source of sex education</b>.</p>
                    <p>However, according to research conducted by the
                    United Nation Population Fund, <b>most parents refrain from having this important conversation
                    with their children out of embarrassment</b>. As such, when the news of ten sixteen-year-old girls
                    being sexually abused by a celebrity came out in 2021, I came to the conclusion that it is now
                    more important than ever to normalize the idea of sex education among parents and their preteen
                    children. </p>
                <p>Taking into account the increasing use of mobile phones in China, it is highly feasible
                    to <b>develop an online platform which teaches parents how to provide at-home sexual education</b>.
                    This project designs the interface of a <b>family-based sexuality education mobile application</b> in a
                    Figma design file. In the future, my project could be the basis for a much-needed sexual health
                    educational app in China.</p>

                <h4 class="pt-5" id="survey">Survey Analysis</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>To better understand current sexual health education in China and the needs of Chinese parents, I conducted a online survey.
                I choose survey over other research methods because it's inexpensive and less time-consuming.
                The survey is completely anonymous so that I can make sure participants feel comfortable to share any thoughts on the topic.
                </p>
                <div class="d-flex">
                    <h5 class="pt-5">1. Survey Conclusions</h5>
                    <img class="ps-2 " src="assets/illustrations/survey.png" width="20%">
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The survey is approved by Institutional Review Board (Protocol: 6256X) and is conducted on the Internet
                        and through WeChat. 112 people took the survey. 52 males and 59 females. The majority of
                        samples are between 19-22 years old.
                    </li>
                    <li>81.25%  participants received information about sex education through the internets and
                        Social Media. 57.14% participants received the information in school.
                    </li>
                    <li>12.5% participants agreed that their parents gave them well-constructed sex education.
                    </li>
                    <li>74.11% participants feel pressure, anxiety or embarrassment when discussing sex-related topic with parents.
                    </li>
                    <li>51.79% and 45.54% participants will not seek help from school or family members when
                        having a sex-related issue. 40.18% and 49.11% participants absolutely and highly
                        possibly seek help from the Internets and social media.</li>
                    <li>83.04% participants believe that adding official Sex education courses in school is the
                        proper way to improve current sex education in China and 73.12% participants choose
                        at-home sex education.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2. Takeaways </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The survey result confirms that current sex education in China is not robust enough,
                        especially family-based sex education. It also shows that the Internet/ Social Media is the
                        best platform to increase public awareness of sex education.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since the current younger generation are highly dependent on Internet information, it is
                        necessary for developers to make sure the information is correct.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most children do not start the conversation on sex topics with parents because they feel
                        equally as embarrassed and anxious as their parent. It is crucial for parents to break the
                        ice and initiate the talk.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="pt-5" id="personas">Personas and User Profile</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>To really get a feel for the target users, I always like to create fictitious personas so that I can jump
                    into the users' shoes and really understand their needs, wants, thoughts, and priorities.
                    The target users typically fall somewhere between this spectrum: </p>
                <img class="pb-4" src="assets/elephant/persona_spe.png" width="100%">
                <p>The profiles are generated based on the survey background responses.
                    With these fictitious users, I can understand what users can use the app for and how their needs are met by the app.
                </p>

                <h4 class="pt-5" id="ideation">Ideation</h4>
                <hr>
                <h6>Design Choices</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conventional features: Profile, Forum, Resource</li>
                    <li>Profitable features: Shopping, Livestreaming</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Detailed Reasoning</h6>
                <p>After establishing the user profiles, I started ideating the app features.
                    The first feature I want to include is the Create Account and Login feature.
                    Since this is a forum-based app, all users should have an account to write or comment on a post.
                    Having an account in the app also makes users feel like they are "living in a community", which encourages them to post and comment.
                    We can also get their emails so that we can send them promotions and keep them updated with our news.
                    The Forum page is also important. It allows users to talk freely and get help from others.
                    Inspired by another sexual health education platform, I added the Resource Section for users to find authoritative resources.
                    Parents can get help not only from other parents but also experts.
                    Those articles can provide a general guidance and the forum is for some practical issues.
                    In sum, the basic features of the app should include the Create account / Login feature, the Profile feature, the Forum feature, and the Resource feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developing and maintaining an app costs money and the company certainly wants to profit from it.
                    To better convince stakeholders that my app is promising, I added the Shopping feature and Livestreaming feature.
                    I think it would be useful to invite some professors or authorities to share their insights on the topic on live.
                    Parents can ask questions and get reliable answers from the authorities.
                    Some professors can also sell related products for at-home sexual health education such as related children's book.
                    Besides related products recommended by the authorities, the shopping page can also include other general parenting products.
                    Parents can share their experience with the product and make recommendations in the Forum section.
                    With these functions, the app now is not just a platform to get information but also a platform to improve parenting experience.

                <h4 class="pt-5" id="appflow">App Flow</h4>
                <hr>
                <h6>Design Choices</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bottom toolkit (bottom navigation bar) design</li>
                    <li>Home page design</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Detailed Reasoning</h6>
                <p>After finishing my ideation, I asked my advisor for suggestions on app flow design.
                   We both agreed that the first page users lands on should be the home page where users can choose which section he/she wants to visit.
                   We also agreed to have a toolkit (bottom navigation bar) at the bottom for users to better find directions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Referencing back to some existing apps, I decided to have the Settings page and Profile page in the toolkit.
                    Most of our target users are parents and some of them are not versed in using smartphones, so I want to make sure
                    that they can easily access the pages where they can change their personal info and other settings of the app.
                    I also want to include the "make post" button so that we can encourage users to post more frequently.
                    Later on, I decided to add a message button which allows users to communicate with each other more easily and build a stronger community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the home page, I want to make sure users have access to all the featured sections including Forum, Resource, Shopping, and Livestreaming.
                    Other flows such as Login and Shopping, I take some existing apps like Amazon and Shein as references.
                    Most referenced apps share the same flow, and I consider them as the "conventional flows".
                    Using the conventional flows can ensure my app is new-user-friendly.
                    Even users who are not smartphone-savvy can follow.

                    I chose the color yellow and orange to be the main color theme of the app because orange is the color commonly used for education and make people feel welcome.
                    Orange color can also boost activity level and spark two-way communication according to a research result.

                    Inspired by the line "Make sex eduction no longer the elephant in the room", I named the app "Elephant Edu".
                    The logo is an elephant with a nose looks like a key: the key that opens the door of the "room".

                    To avoid unrealistic design, I designed all the components with reference to Antdesign and other existing UI components libraries.
                    Most components are reusable, such as Cards and Forum, and all the layout can be implemented with flexbox or grid system.

                    This project helps me understand design process and get hands-on experience in designing an app.
                I enjoyed the time I spent ideating and designing it in Figma. I realized that designers have to consider
                 not only users but also stakeholders and engineers when designing interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides the design skills I gained from this experience, I also feel the social responsibility designers have.
                    In the future, my project could be the basis for a much-needed sexual health
                    educational app in China. Current sex education in China is the elephant in the room
                    and I hope my app can be the key to the "room".
                </p>
                <h6>Possible Improvement</h6>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints, I was not able to finish all the screens of the app, especially the Setting section.
                    There are also some improvement that I would make if I can redesign it.
                    Current design does not give the Forum section the highest level hierarchy.
                    Users have to first land on the home page, and then click on a post to browse the Forum section.
                    They can also easily access Livestreaming and Shopping sections on the home screen.
                    Shopping and Livestreaming should be a side product; they should not have the same hierarchy as the Forum and Articles section.
                    If I can redesign it, I would make Forum section on the home screen, posts are ranked by recommendation.
                    I would also add some articles from the resources in the Forum posts.
                </p>
